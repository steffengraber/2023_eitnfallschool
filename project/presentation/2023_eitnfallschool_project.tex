  \begin{itemize}\itemsep1ex
  \item<1-> both in nature and in Computational Neuroscience, neuronal network dynamics can become unstable, leading either
    \begin{itemize}\itemsep1ex
    \item to an explosion of network activity or other pathological states, or
    \item to dying out of network activity
    \end{itemize}
    often accompanied by a loss of network functionality
  \item<2-> typical causes:
    \begin{itemize}\itemsep1ex
    \item<2-> strong excitatory feedback:
      \begin{itemize}\itemsep1ex
      \item[] firing activity $\uparrow$
      \item[$\curvearrowright$]
        synaptic input $\uparrow$
      \item[$\curvearrowright$]
        firing activity $\uparrow$
      \item[\ldots]
      \end{itemize}
    \item<3-> correlation-based plasticity dynamics, such as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP):
      \begin{itemize}\itemsep1ex
      \item[] correlations in firing activity of a pair neurons $\uparrow$
      \item[$\curvearrowright$] synaptic coupling between them $\uparrow$
      \item[$\curvearrowright$] correlations in firing activity  $\uparrow$
      \item[\ldots]
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item<4-> typical countermeasures
    \begin{itemize}\itemsep1ex
    \item Computational Neuroscience: laborious parameter tuning and/or unrealistic assumptions
    \item (healthy) brains: \emph{homeostatic regulation}
    \end{itemize}

        (transient) regulation of postsynaptic response amplitude (``synaptic weight'') based on presynaptic activity level

      \item<3-> inhibitory plasticity \alert{(minutes--hours)}:
        regulation of strength of inhibitory connections controlled by pre- and postsynaptic activity (spike-timing-dependent plasticity)\\
        {\tiny \parencite{Hennequin17_557}}
      \item<4-> synaptic scaling \alert{(days)}:
        regulation of synaptic weights based on postsynaptic activity level\\

      \item<5-> synaptic normalization \alert{(hours--days)}:
        long-term synaptic plasticity under the constraint that the total amount of synaptic ressources per neuron (e.g.~postsynaptic receptors) is constant
        {\tiny\parencite{Hartmann15_e1004640}}
      \item<6-> structural plasticity \alert{(hours-days)}:
        removal or formation of connections controlled by postsynaptic activity level (``synaptic turnover'')

      \item<3-> observe how the network activity evolves into an epileptic high-activity state for high levels of synaptic potentiation (learning rate)
      \item<4-> extend the model with one (or several) of the mentioned forms of homeostasis
      \item<5-> investigate if the destabilization of network activity by strong synaptic potentiation can be prevented by the implemented form of homeostasis
      \item<6-> investigate how the implemented form of homeostasis affects network dynamics in the absence or presence of external perturbations (such as average firing rates, level of correlations in firing activity, power spectra of population activity, sensitivity to perturbations)\\
